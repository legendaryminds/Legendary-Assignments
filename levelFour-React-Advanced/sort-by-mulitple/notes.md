The !== operator in JavaScript is the strict inequality operator. It compares two values to see if they are not equal in both value and type. This is the opposite of the strict equality operator (===).

Hereâ€™s how it works:

If the values being compared are of different types, !== will return true.
If the values are of the same type but have different values, !== will return true.
If the values are of the same type and have the same value, !== will return false.
