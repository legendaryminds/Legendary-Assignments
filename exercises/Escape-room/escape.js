// Write a game that lets a user escape a room. The character finds him/herself locked in a room. In order to escape the room, your character needs to find the key in the room and then open the door. There's also a hole in the wall in the room. If your character puts his hand in the hole, he dies.

// # **Game start:**

// Tell the user their options:

// 1. Find the key, or
// 2. Put hand in hole
// 3. Open the door
    
// const items = ["Desk", "Cushioned Chair", "Rug", "Cabinet", "Hole in Wall", "Trinket Box on Desk", "Love Seat"];   

// for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++){
//     if (items[i] === "Hole in Wall") {
//         console.log(
//           "You have chosen unwisely and have been bitten by a spider. You are dying rapidly. Game over."
//         )

// They can't open the door unless they find the key first.They die if they put their hand in the hole.
